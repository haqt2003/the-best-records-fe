          The purpose of this policy is to define how The Best Records collects,
          processes, stores, and protects personal and sensitive data to ensure
          compliance with data protection laws and maintain the privacy and
          confidentiality of individuals' data. This policy applies to all
          employees, contractors, and third parties that interact with or
          process data on behalf of The Best Records. It covers all data
          collected, whether electronically or physically, and includes all
          operational procedures related to data management. Personal data
          refers to information that can identify an individual directly or
          indirectly, such as name, address, email, or phone number. Sensitive
          data requires additional protection and includes information such as
          financial details, health records, racial or ethnic origin, and
          religious beliefs. A data subject is any individual whose personal
          data is collected, held, or processed by The Best Records. A data
          processor is responsible for processing data on behalf of the data
          controller, who determines the purposes and means of processing
          personal data.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          Data must be collected and processed lawfully, fairly, and in a
          transparent manner. The purpose of data collection must be clearly
          communicated to the data subject, and where necessary, their consent
          must be obtained. Data should only be collected for specified,
          explicit, and legitimate purposes, and it must not be further
          processed in ways that are incompatible with these original purposes.
          The principle of data minimization dictates that only the minimum
          amount of personal data necessary for the intended purpose should be
          collected and processed. Additionally, data accuracy is essential;
          therefore, every effort should be made to ensure that personal data is
          accurate, complete, and kept up to date. Inaccurate data must be
          rectified or deleted promptly.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          Data should not be retained longer than necessary for the specified
          purpose, in accordance with applicable legal or regulatory
          requirements. Proper security measures must be in place to protect
          data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
          destruction. These measures include encryption, access controls,
          regular security assessments, and employee training. Furthermore, The
          Best Records must ensure that any third parties or contractors that
          process data on its behalf comply with this policy and the relevant
          data protection laws. Regular audits and assessments will be conducted
          to monitor compliance, and breaches or violations of this policy will
          be met with appropriate corrective actions, which may include
          penalties or disciplinary action. This policy will be reviewed
          periodically and updated to reflect changes in data protection laws
          and best practices. All employees and relevant parties are required to
          adhere strictly to this policy, and any questions or concerns
          regarding data protection should be directed to the Data Protection
          Officer at The Best Records.
